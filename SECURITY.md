# Security Policy

Please use the app at your own risk. It is in BETA and has not gone through a formal security autdit, scan, code review or assessment.

The focus right now is on functionality and bug fixes and will become mature with time and frequent updates.

There is a huge list of tasks we care coding in the backend and everything goes in the pipeline, milestones and roadmap.
There's only so much I can do with the limited time and knowledge I have. So please be kind and patient. (I've already had people point out 50 flaws in 2 days 👏🏼🙄. I'm taking notes and will eventually get there.)

Expect security holes, bugs and flaws. Use it at yor own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you find a security misconfiguration, vulnerability or anything that can heighten security, please report it by either emailing me (security@operationprivacy.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0perationP) dm or mesaging me using the [Matrix/Element](https://matrix.to/#/#OperationPrivacy:matrix.org) chat.

**Important:** When reporting a vulnerability, please make sure to suggest a detailed fix as well, it will save me time. (Because I too have a laundry list of fixes that I'm prioritizing)
