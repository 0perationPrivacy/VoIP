# Security Policy

Please use the app at your own risk. It is in BETA and has not gone through a formal security autdit, scan, code review or assessment.

The focus right now is on functionality and bug fixes are being addressed as I see them and reported in the issues section.

There is a huge list of tasks we are working on in the backend and everything goes in the pipeline, milestones, roadmap and/or issues.
There's only so much I can do with the limited time and knowledge I have. So please be kind and patient. If you want to contribute, please reach out.

> Expect security holes, bugs and flaws. Use it at yor own risk.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When you find a security misconfiguration, vulnerability or anything that can improve overall security or privacy, please report it by either emailing me (security@operationprivacy.com) or mesaging using the [Matrix/Element](https://matrix.to/#/#OperationPrivacy:matrix.org) chat.

**Important:** When reporting a vulnerability, please make sure to suggest a detailed fix as well, it will save me time. (Because I too have a laundry list of fixes that I'm prioritizing). The output of a vulnerability or code scan will be igonored as we already have those and don't add any value to actually finding one.
